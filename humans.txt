My name is Ri Xu (续日). You can call me Luxurioust. I was born in 1990s. I am an university student, learning in Heilongjiang University of Science & Technology in Harbin, China.
I focused on the program design, web development, Linux and open source software.
In spare time, I like listening classical music, surfing internet, play the clarinet and taking a leisurely walk outdoors.
